# Installation

Badger is essentially a python package. It's recommended to install and test it in a separate [python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) before using it in a production env.

## Requirements

- Python version >= 3.9. Python 3.11+ is recommended

## Install the Badger package

Badger has a core package (`badger-opt`) that can be extended by a set of plugins. Badger core package is available on both [pip](https://pypi.org/project/badger-opt/) and [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/badger-opt). So you could install Badger with:

```shell
pip install badger-opt
```

Or

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge badger-opt
```

That's it!
